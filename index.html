    <div class="intro">
        <p>I am interested in a Technical Sales position at Pulumi. With my extensive background in technical sales and my passion for delivering exceptional customer experiences, I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to the fast-paced sales team and contribute to a winning growth story.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="experience">
        <p>At both Harness and Elastic, I had the privilege to work with DevSecOps stakeholders across use cases including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Containerization Platforms (AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Azure AKS, Helm, Docker)</li>
            <li>Serverless (Lambda, Fargate, Cloud Functions, CloudRun, Azure Functions)</li>
            <li>Digital DevOps CI/CD (Jenkins, Azure DevOps, AWS Code Pipeline, Gitlab CI, Git, etc.)</li>
            <li>Databases (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, MSSQL, MySql)</li>
            <li>Infra-As-Code (Pulumi, CloudFormation, Terraform)</li>
            <li>Data Warehousing (AWS Redshift, GCP BigQuery, Snowflake)</li>
            <li>Networking (OpenVPN, AWS VPN, VPCs, Public/Private Subnets, DNS, Load Balancing, Routing)</li>
            <li>Infrastructure (Unix Bash Shell, RHEL, CentOS, Debian Linux)</li>
            <li>Frontend + Backend Dev (ReactJS, NodeJS, Java, Typescript, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="unique-value">
        <p>I'm driven primarily by my customers. My ability to provide technical value at every stage of the sales cycle is what makes me different. When combined with a data-driven sales methodology and communication style that emphasizes active listening, I can increase sales velocity while also closing bigger and stickier deals.</p>
    </div>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read my cover letter! I hope to be in touch soon.</p>

        <h2>Teammate Testimonials:</h2>
        <div class="quote">
            <p>“Josh is an incredibly gifted person and a huge asset to have on the team. I have never had an SDR have the technical knowledge that he has and still have the hunger to learn more! It's refreshing to not have to motivate Josh, as he is very driven and self-motivated to be successful. One thing that I love about having Josh on my team is the interest in identifying the real value for a customer. Josh is always asking to attend customer demonstrations to learn more and gain insights that he can leverage while prospecting for new opportunities. I am thankful to have Josh on my team.”</p>

            <p>“I worked directly with Josh to close multiple deals at Elastic. We closed a deal in his first week. His sales skills and work ethic were apparent. What made Josh different was his technical understanding of Elastic. He can speak to technical executives and end-users in a way that most sales reps can’t. It not only saved my team time and money but also the support team as well. It shortened the sales cycle and made everyone better.”</p>

        <div class="quote">
            <p>“Josh is dynamic and creative, with high-octane energy that yields results. His results were actually ranked number one globally for generating opportunities as an SDR. With a team mentality, he was critical in creating the playbook for other SDRs in the organization as well. Josh has an innate gift for sales and is an extremely agile learner. Some of my favorite memories at Flexport were with Josh. He is incredibly fun to work with.”</p>
